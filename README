libuntar - C library for extracting tar files
======

libuntar is a library for manipulating tar files from within C programs.

It is based on libtar from http://repo.or.cz/w/libtar.git

The idea is to remove all code for creating and appending to tarfiles,
add tests, and remove all support for obsolete platforms, and simplify
the build process, so there is just a very minimal library to extract
tar files, optionally with compression.

Current build instructions:

   set CFLAGS, LDFLAGS if required
   make

There is an example untar program using the library.
